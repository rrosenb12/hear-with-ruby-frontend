          New York State, along with many others, does not require insurance
          companies to cover the expenses of hearing impairment. Thus, families
          with children with hearing loss pay, out of pocket, for hearing aids,
          hearing aid molds, batteries, cleaning supplies, personal
          FM/microphone systems, and more. We are exceptionally fortunate that,
          with the support of our family, we have been able to cover the costs
          associated with Rubyâ€™s hearing loss. To be able to give our daughters
          what they need is a privilege and a blessing.
        </p>
        <p className="col-12">
          It is that blessing that motivates us to support all families with
          hearing impaired children to do the same.
