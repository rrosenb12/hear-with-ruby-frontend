        <b id="title">Ruby</b> is a spunky, spirited, bright and beautiful almost 5 year old girl.
        She loves fairies, princesses, and everything sparkly. She is a
        creative, talented artist, and has a love for dancing, especially
        ballet. Ruby loves to sing, and often makes up her own songs as she
        paints, cooks, walks and plays. Ruby enjoys cooking and baking with her
        mom and taking rides on her scooter with her dad. Most of all, Ruby is a
        proud big sister to Jayne.
