        We have cried tears of joy watching
        our daughter’s face light up when she hears the crashing sound of waves,
        the sing song of birds, the rush of the wind, and the hush of our
        soothing her when she cries or drifts off to sleep. We have felt the
        electric shock of pride as we watch her advocate for herself; asking her
        soccer coach to lower the music a little, requesting that someone face
        her as they speak to her, suggesting that her friend wear a clear mask
        so she can see her lips as they speak to one another. We have soothed
        her sadness as she cried that “something is wrong with me”, and “I am
        jealous that my friends can stay at the party, but it is too hard for
        me.” We have loved watching Ruby show off her sparkly hearing aid
        charms, which she wears with pride and glee, and smiled as Ruby has
        reported “I am worried that Sydney (her best friend & cousin) will be
        jealous of my super ears and sparkly new molds!”
