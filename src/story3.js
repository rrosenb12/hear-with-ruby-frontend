        In hindsight, Ruby’s diagnosis makes a lot of sense. She often struggled
        in large crowds and social situations where there were loud sounds
        and/or many people talking. She was physically exhausted at the end of a
        morning at school, often struggling to make it through an after school
        class like yoga or ballet. She rarely answered when a caregiver called
        across a room for her, and liked to listen to her iPad, or the
        television, quite loud. When considered all together, these reflections
        surely sound like symptoms of hearing loss. But for us as her parents,
        they were easily excused as typical toddler behaviors that were not
        worrisome, and even typical. When we set aside the guilt we feel about
        not realizing Ruby’s hearing loss sooner, we are so grateful that she
        will spend her life with the support she needs to hear.
