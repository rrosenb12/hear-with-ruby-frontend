        Ruby received her hearing aids on May 11, 2020. The adjustment to them
        was a roller coaster; she loved them, hated them, and then loved them
        again. We created team Hear With Ruby immediately, and began raising
        awareness about hearing loss. We surrounded Ruby with positive images of
        others with hearing impairments, doctoring images of her favorite
        princesses and role models to wear aids just like her. We received the
        gift of a doll wearing pink bilateral aids identical to Ruby’s, and
        bought every book we could find about hearing impairment and aids. We
        celebrated with a party when they arrived, and friends sent pairs of
        charms to add to Ruby’s collection. We told Ruby that everyone is born
        with qualities that make them unique and special, and she loves to meet
        new people and ask,

        We made her a social story all about her aids to share with her friends
        at school, and proudly walked with the Walk4Hearing in October 2020.
