        While we have done all we can think of to create joy and appreciation
        for Ruby’s super ears, Ruby’s hearing impairment creates many
        opportunities for overcoming. Listening to the world through hearing
        aids creates challenges; a tapping toe close to her sounds louder than
        her teacher’s voice across the room, chirping birds overcome her friend
        calling to her from across the playground, the sounds of gatherings are
        overwhelming and stressful, listening and learning through technology is
        complicated. And more than anything, a world of voices from behind masks
        is exhausting, and frustrating, to try to listen to. At the end of the
        day, working to tune out the excess, focus on the important sounds, and
        listen through her super ears is physically and mentally exhausting for
        Ruby.
